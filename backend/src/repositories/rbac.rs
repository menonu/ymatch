//! RBAC repository — read path for scoped role assignments.
//!
//! [`RbacRepository`] owns the `user_roles` table operations needed by
//! [`crate::services::rbac::RbacService`]. The role/permission *catalog*
//! (which roles exist and which permissions each role grants) is static
//! between migrations, so it is loaded once at startup into the in-memory
//! [`crate::services::permission_catalog::PermissionCatalog`] rather than
//! queried per check. Only `user_roles` — which changes at runtime as
//! roles are assigned/revoked — is queried per authorization decision.
//!
//! See `docs/explanation/adr/0004-rbac-permission-model.md` for the model.
//!
//! PR 2 of #228 added the read path (`role_ids_for_user`). PR 3a adds the
//! `event/creator` auto-assignment used at event creation (ADR 0004 §5); the
//! remaining write path (assign/revoke `editor`, list members) is added in a
//! later PR alongside the event-member endpoints that consume it.
